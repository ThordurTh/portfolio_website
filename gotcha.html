        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Gotcha is a recently opened bubble tea café located in Nørrebro. The
          owner was very willing to get some help with his website and
          suggestions on how to build a better social media image. At the time
          there were only a couple of months since he launched the café which
          had its pros and cons. Social media presence was quite limited and the
          website was non-existent so there was a lot to do. The owner had been
          in contact with a designer for a logo and other visual design, but
          that was about it. That left us with (almost) a clean slate to build
          from which gave us a lot of freedom.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          This project revolved around using everything we had learned
          throughout the school year 2021-2022 which includes design, marketing
          and coding. We kicked things off by interviewing the owner to get some
          fundamental information about what his goals and visions are.
          Thereafter was there plenty of research to be done on both the target
          group and competitors.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Based on everything we gathered, it was time to make a style guide,
          so-me guide and wireframes. We then started development on video
          concepts both for the website and so-me and a prototype for the
          website. We conducted testing such as trunk and think-aloud tests
          which helped us pinpoint problems that we had overseen.

        <p>
          It was my task to manage the code for the website. I wrote semantic
          HTML to the best of my knowledge to give browsers the correct
          information and image alt tags for accessibility. In these fortunate
          times where CSS properties such as flex and grid exist, did I make
          full use of them to position elements and to make the website
          responsive. The “menu” page consists of items that I put into a
          wordpress database and fetched using javascript. We decided to use
          wordpress since its UI is quite simple which makes it easy for the
          client to add or remove items.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          All in all this project gave me insight into how it is to work on an
          online presence for a client from start to finish. Using my knowledge
          to meet the client's needs and wishes as well as presenting your own
          solutions based on research was quite rewarding.
